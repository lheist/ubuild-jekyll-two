  slug: " hidden treasure after he announced in a 2010 "
  content: Forrest Fenn, an eccentric New Mexico art dealer who enticed thousands
    to search for hidden treasure after he announced in a 2010 book that he had stashed
    a bronze chest filled with gold nuggets and jewels somewhere in the Rocky Mountains,
    died on Sept. 7 at his home in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 90.His death was confirmed
    by a grandson, Shiloh Old.It came just three months after Mr. Fenn said someone
    had finally <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/us/treasure-chest-rocky-mountains.html"
    title="">found the treasure chest, which held, by his estimate, $2 million worth
    of </a>gold nuggets, sapphires, diamonds, pre-Columbian artifacts and other riches.“It
    was under a canopy of stars in the lush, forested vegetation of the Rocky Mountains
    and had not moved from the spot where I hid it more than 10 years ago,” Mr. Fenn
    <a href="https://www.oldsantafetradingco.com/the-thrill-resource-page" title="">said
    on his website</a> in June. He did not give the exact location.“I do not know
    the person who found it, but the poem in my book led him to the precise spot,”
    he added. His self-published 2010 memoir, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thrill-Chase-Forrest-Fenn/dp/0967091780"
    title="">“The Thrill of the Chase,”</a> provided clues to the chest’s location
    in the verses of a poem.A man who did not want to be identified <a href="https://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/forrest-fenn-confirms-his-treasure-has-been-found/article_37006cfe-a8d7-11ea-8653-873ca96e31ef.html"
